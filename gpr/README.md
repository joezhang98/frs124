# Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR)
Over the course of one week in late March 2017, I and four other students in FRS 124: State of the Earth (Shifts and Cycles) participated in a research project at Dune du Pilat, France.  Using Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) techniques, we mapped out transects on the surface of Dune du Pilat.  The resulting images were analyzed and interpreted in MATLAB to determine the structure and history of the sand dune, and whether it posed an immediate danger to the residents living beside it.

In late April, we presented our findings to an audience of graduate students and professors in the Department of Geology at Princeton University.
