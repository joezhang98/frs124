# Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR)
Over the course of one week in March 2017, I and four other students in FRS124: State of the Earth (Shifts and Cycles) participated in a research project at Dune du Pilat, France.  Using Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) techniques, we mapped out transects on the surface of Dune du Pilat.  The recorded images were analyzed and interpreted in MATLAB to determine the structure and history of the sand dune, and so we were able to determine the future of the dune's growth and evolution, and thus whether it posed an immediate danger to the residents who lived just east of the dune's extent.

In late April, we presented our findings to an audience of graduate students and professors in the Department of Geology at Princeton University.  A copy of the presentation can be found [here](http://geoweb.princeton.edu/people/simons/PDF/FRS-SESC-S2017-GPR.pdf).
