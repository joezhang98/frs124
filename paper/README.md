Title: 

The Effects of Crater Topography on Surface Wind Patterns as Recorded by Dune Fields on Mars

Abstract:

Deciphering the climatic history of Mars requires an understanding of current climate and weather.  One important aspect of Martian weather modelling consists of global wind patterns.  Current Global Climate Models (GCMs) of the Martian atmosphere correlate poorly with local wind directions defined over cratered regions on the scale of 1-100 square kilometers.  These wind directions are inferred from slip face orientations of intra-crater and inter-crater dunes.  This study aims to better understand the correlation by quantifying the effects of crater topography on the near-surface wind regime.  Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) are analyzed to determine the orientations and amplitudes of dunes in the equatorial region, and comparisons are made between similar geographic locations.  Dune field orientation in Xainza Crater is shown to exhibit a 16.5 degree difference over a distance of 2 km, and dune field orientations in Herschel Crater and Meroe Patera are shown to change by 16 degrees due to the presence of 500-1000m diameter impact craters.  Dune amplitude is not significantly affected by local topography.  Crater topography thus introduces complexities to near-surface wind regimes that must be taken into account when comparing the results of local studies to GCMs and other theoretical models.
